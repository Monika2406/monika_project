Air Quality Forecasting
Technologies: Python, FB Prophet, Data Cleaning, Pandas, Matplotlib

1.Worked on a time series project to analyze and forecast air quality trends using historical data.

2.Performed data pre-processing and cleaning to handle missing values and outliers in environmental data.

3.Used FB Prophet (a time series forecasting model by Meta) to predict future air quality for the upcoming year.

4.Visualized trends and seasonal patterns to support data-driven environmental insights.

This project enhanced my skills in Python programming, and real-world data forecasting.
